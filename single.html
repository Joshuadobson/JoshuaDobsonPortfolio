								<h2>An overview</h2>
								<p>I began my degree in Economics and Finance in 2022. Over the past 4 years i've undertaken a variety of modules and projects, and even had the opportunity to study abroad in Denmark. The following page details modules and projects I found particuarly intersting over the years</p>
								<h3>First Year</h3>
								<p>My first year of content mainly covered the basics of economics and quantitative skills, in order to bring the entire cohort up to scratch. Notable modules included: Intro to Finance, Mathematics for Economics, Macroeconomics and Microeconmics. Whilst the content itself wasn't hugely challenging, the transition into the university workflow took time for me. I was comfortable with the 'spoon-fed' nature of A-Level life and quickly learned of the independant nature of university. </p>
								<h3>Second Year</h3>
								<p>Second year was certainly a step up in pace. Whilst 7,8 modules were mandatory, I had the opportunity to study Game Theory which greatly influenced my though process when tackling economic problems. Another standout was Econometrics, this module aided my logistical thinking when evaluating data trends and their meaning. The combination of these two modules has stuck with me until present as I now view real world data through a much more sceptical and analytical lense.</p>
								<h3>Year Abroard - Copenhagen Business School</h3>
								<p>An aspect of my degree I'm most thankful for is my opportunity to study for a year in Denmark. This section will run through the business school specifically, but an article on my full experience can be read here. The business school itself was very different to my current experience at Exeter. Firstly, each lecture and tutorial lasted at least 3 hours (compared to a maximum of 2 hours in Exeter). Lectures were also unrecorded and were typically in clsses of around 30-40. Similarly, all in-person exams lasted 4 hours and would allow for food and drink to be brough into the exam hall. I found this really allowed for me to produce my best work on complex problems, rather than being rushed for time over more basic questions.  </p>
								<p>CBS offered a range of unique and exciting modules over the year. One that really excited me was 'a gentle introduction to computational economics'. This went through the basics of python and then dove into how python can be used to simulate thousands of distributions quickly to test different hypothesis. At the time I was begging to teach myself html and css, so this made for a really nice addition to my learning. Another more conceptually interesting module was 'Behavioural finance'; one of the most frustrating parts of economics for me is its assumptions on consumer rationality and strict preferences. This module went through the realities of conumser choice (what is seen in the real world) and how alot of this can still be explained by models.</p>
